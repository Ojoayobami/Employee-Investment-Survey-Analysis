Observation

Annual Income by Age

Age 26 had the highest sum of annual income. This could be as a result of multiple jobs that led to multiple streams of income.

Annual Income by Gender

The male gender tops the annual income by gender. This could be a result of the family and societal roles and responsibilities of the male gender.

Goal of Investment


The top goal for investment is wealth generation. This could also signify having enough to live comfortable lives and to take care of the family.

Working Professional

The top working professional is the male gender, which is as a result of its duties and responsibilities to the family.

Investment by Month

From this analysis, the male gender invest more per month which is as a result of catering for the family and leaving inheritance for them.

Mode of Investment

The male gender invests more in mutual funds. This is a situation where a company pools money from many vestments to buy stocks, bonds, and other investments. This is cost-effective.

Recommendation

Financial Literacy Programs

Conduct workshops or training to educate people about various investment options, risks, and benefits. Focus on bridging the gap for younger participants who rely on family and social media. 

Gender-Specific Insights:

Investigate investment barriers or preferences by gender, and address any disparities with targeted campaigns or product offerings. 

Investment by women should also be encouraged. In some cases, the male gender passes away, leaving the women to suffer due to a lack of investment or financial backup for themselves.

Before investing in a specific type of investment, the male should be aware of their financial capabilities and increase their investment knowledge.

Goals of Investment

Design campaigns that align with common goals such as wealth generation and retirement planning. Use relatable success stories to inspire confidence.

The goal of investment should not be limited to wealth generation. Children's education, catering, preparing for difficult times, and achieving financial independence after retirement should all be encouraged.

Encourage long-term saving

Using education and practical examples, highlight the advantages of consistent, long-term investments. Provide tools to predict future wealth growth based on savings timelines.

Improved Digital Tools

Encourage the use of mobile apps and platforms to assist investors in making more informed decisions. Create user-friendly dashboards to track goals and performance.

Conclusion

The Employee Investment Survey Analysis reveals a wide range of investment preferences motivated by long-term objectives such as wealth creation and financial independence. While many people use traditional and digital decision-making tools, there are still gaps in financial literacy, particularly among young people and those with lower incomes. Addressing these gaps through targeted education and easily accessible tools can empower individuals, resulting in improved financial outcomes and a more confident workforce.
